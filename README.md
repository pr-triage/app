> GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that add an appropriate label depend on the PR's status.


## Motivation

Firstly, I started to create PRTriage to solve my own pain. As an engineer, I spent my time to ask colleagues Pull Requests status such as `WIP (work in progress)`・`UNREVIEWED`・`CHANGES_REQUESTED`・`APPROVED`. Most of the developers use [GitHub](https://github.com) and follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)/[Git Flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html). Most of them say that the time it takes to know pull request status is getting increasing as the team is large so I published it as Open Source :sparkles:.

## Installation

Please follow the below steps to install quickly :rocket::

1. Go to [PRTriage App top page](https://probot.github.io/apps/pr-triage/)
1. Click **"+ Add to GitHub"** button
1. Choose a repository
1. That's it :sparkles:


## How it works

Only watching the most recent commit :eyes::

- Do nothing when the PR's title starts from `WIP`, `[WIP]` or `WIP:`.
- Add the `PR: unreviewed` label when the PR does not have any reviews.
- Add the `PR: reviewed-changes-requested` label when the PR has reviewed and got `Change request` event.
- Add the `PR: review-approved` label when the PR has reviewed and got `Approve` event.
