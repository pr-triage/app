PRTriage does **"NOT"** have permission to `Read & Write` your code :see_no_evil:. For more details, see [Permission and Subscribe section](#permission--subscribe-event). If you have any question, please free to ask us via [creating an issue](https://github.com/pr-triage/pr-triage/issues/new?labels=question).

1. :runner: Go to [PRTriage App Page](https://github.com/apps/pr-triage)
1. :rocket: Click **Install**
1. :mag: Please choose a repository
1. :sparkles: That's it.


## How it works

<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1587053/35917561-f4928e02-0c51-11e8-95d3-81b4f44ed6d2.png" width="100%">

- Do nothing if your title of PR starts from `WIP`, `[WIP]` or `WIP:`.
- Add a `PR: unreviewed` label if your PR does not have any reviews for latest commit.
- Add a `PR: reviewed-changes-requested` label if your PR have reviewed and got **Change request** for latest commit.
- Add a `PR: review-approved` label if your PR have reviewed and got **Approve** for latest commit.


## Permission & Subscribe event

Here are permission and event PRTriage is requested and subscribe:

- :x: **No** access to code
- :white_check_mark: Read access to metadata
- :white_check_mark: Read and write access to pull requests to create, add and remove labels PRTriage manipulate.

  1. Set `APP_ID` in `.env` to the ID.
  1. Set `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env` to the `development`.

```

Simulate a pull request review event:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/probot simulate pull_request_review test/simulates/pull_request_review.submitted.approved.json ./index.js
```
