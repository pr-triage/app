## Motivation

Firstly, I started to create PRTriage to solve my own pain. As an engineer, I spent my time to ask pull requests status such as WIP, Reviewed, Need change or Approved. Most of developers use [GitHub](https://github.com) and follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and most of people say that the time it takes to know pull request status is getting increasing as team is large.
